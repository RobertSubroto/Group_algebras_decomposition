# Group_algebras_decomposition
Python code for computing the indecomposable components of a commutative group algebra over a finite field.
In module theory, this is known as the Krull-Remak-Schmidt decomposition, or KRS for short.
Studying these group algebras was one of the major topics of my PhD research.
